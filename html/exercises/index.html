    <h1>Why I Love Web Development</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Reason 1: Coding work keeps my brain actively engaged</li>
      <li>Reason 2: I gain a tangible sense of accomplish when the code I wrote works properly</li>
      <li>Reason 3: Web Development jobs pay much more than Higher Education jobs!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Watching anime has been a favorite pass time of mine for almost a decade now. Sometimes there are many shows <br>
    that I'd like to watch at the same time, some that release new episodes on a weekly basis and others that have new seasons <br>
    that are already completed. This can make watching all of my shows a bit of a daunting task. <br> <br>

    To resolve this problem, I'd like to create a website which organizes all of the shows that I am interested using different categories. <br>
   For example, some categories would be: 
   <ul>
    <li>Genre</li>
    <li>Streaming Service</li>
    <li>Currently airing or already complete</li>
    <li>Number of episodes watched/remaining</li>
   </ul>
    </p>
